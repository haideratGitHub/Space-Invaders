## About

Space Invaders is a two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player controls a ship with bullets by moving it horizontally
across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The player defeats an alien,
and earns points (one point per kill), by shooting it with the bullet. As more aliens are defeated and player spend more time in the game, the aliens' movement,
the alien's firing frequency and number of aliens firing at a moment speeds up with increase in level of game.

The aliens attempt to destroy the ship by firing at it while they approach the bottom of the screen. If they reach the bottom or 
their fireball hit the spaceship, the spaceship will be destroyed, hence the alien invasion is successful and the game ends.
